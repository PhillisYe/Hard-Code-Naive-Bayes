# Hard-Code-Naive-Bayes

The task is to implement an improved version of the Naive Bayes algorithm that is able to predict the domain
- one of Archaea, Bacteria, Eukaryota or Virus - from the abstract of research papers about proteins taken from 
the MEDLINE database. Then apply the implementation on a test set (tst.csv) without class labels and done the 
predictions of the implementation.

### The challenge

The ultimate goal of this programming project is to come up with an implementation of an extended or modified 
Naive Bayes algorithm, that achieves a high predictive accuracy on the test data.

The implementation includes scratch the data preprocessing, the Naive Bayes algorithm, model validation (cross-validaton), 
and model performance metrics. We are not allowed to use already existing Naive Bayes implementations or use packages 
for data preprocessing, ML or NLP tasks.

This task is implemented with the core functionality of Python.  We only use numpy to represent data as arrays.

### Datasets

Training data: trg.csv  
Test data: test.csv
